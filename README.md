# Competition-Practice

This was coding practice I did in my sophomore and junior years of high school. I had only begun coding when I was in my freshman year of high school, so all of these problems were to enhance concepts in data structures, algorithms skills, and object modeling.

Some of the code I wrote for the problems also include test data, so I have structured them in separate packages.
